### Chapter 5: Prompting Fundamentals

Specifications: define what the bot always must do and must never do. Add your personal taste there. 

Components of a good prompt:
1. Role and objective "You are ___, you do ___"
2. Instruction and rules: answer order, do's and don'ts
3. Context: Relevant background info. Bot can't read your mind
4. Examples or few shot prompting. Implicit Q&A
5. Output formating: JSON, yaml, md lists

Experiment a lot, iterate. 

If you are not domain expert, understand your user very well, put on product hat.
